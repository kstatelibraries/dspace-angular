  <p>Attach your final manuscript (post peer-review).  When we add your work to K-REx, it's important that we comply with your publisher's policy regarding institutional repositories.  For most articles, we need to have your final, reviewed, revised manuscript rather than the publisher-formatted version.  If we are permitted to use the published version we will.</p>

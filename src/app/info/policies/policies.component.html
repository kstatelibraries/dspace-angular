        Policies on submitting works to K-REx
    </h1>

    <h2>Faculty and staff submissions</h2>
    <p>
        Any Kansas State University faculty or staff member may submit their research, scholarly and creative activities, and discovery (RSCAD) works to K-REx. Submitted works can be from any point in one's career.
    </p>

    <h2>Student submissions</h2>
    <p>K-State students may request that their works are included in K-REx if <strong>all</strong> the following conditions are met:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The student must be current and affiliated with K-State.</li>
        <li>A current faculty or staff member of K-State is listed as a co-creator (co-author) for the work <strong>or</strong> a current K-State faculty member academically associated with the student or their host department must sponsor the work.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Sponsoring student submissions</h3>
    <p>
        Sponsorship by a current K-State faculty member is required for any student work being considered for
        inclusion in the institutional repository (IR) if a current K-State faculty or a staff member is not listed as
        a co-creator/author. The act of sponsoring, as it pertains to this policy, shall be defined as a message,
        submitted via email to the Center for Scholarly Publishing (<a href="mailto:cads@k-state.edu">cads@k-state.edu</a>),
        that the work under consideration for inclusion in K-REx is credible and considered to be of sufficient
        academic quality to be deserving of representing K-State.
    </p>

    <h3>Student RSCAD works from conferences and capstone projects</h3>
    <p>
        K-REx is a great place to store and showcase student RSCAD work, especially works like conference posters and capstone projects.
        Students interested in showcasing their work on K-REx should explore whether they meet the submission conditions listed above
        and then reach out to the Center for Scholarly Publishing at <a href="mailto:cads@k-state.edu">cads@k-state.edu</a>.
        Faculty advisors interested in adding student work to K-REx, such as an undergraduate RSCAD conference,
        should also reach out to the Center for Scholarly Publishing at
        <a href="mailto:cads@k-state.edu">cads@k-state.edu</a> to begin exploring options.
    </p>

    <p>Student works must be eligible to post on the open web regarding 1) FERPA and 2) copyright.</p>

    <h2>Withdrawing items from K-REx</h2>
    <p>
        The author(s), rights holder or K-State administration may request that content be withdrawn from the IR.
        All requests to remove works from the repository must be done in
        writing and sent to <a href="mailto:cads@k-state.edu">cads@k-state.edu</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>Applicability</h3>
    <p>
        This policy applies to works housed in K-State's IR, which has been created by its students, staff and faculty.
    </p>

    <p>
        This withdrawal policy does not apply to works which are considered unique digital collections of
        K-State Libraries and electronic theses, dissertations and reports which have been created and submitted
        to the IR in fulfillment of a degree from K-State.
    </p>

    <h3>Non-creators and non-authors</h3>
    <p>
        Under extreme cases, the request by non-creators and non-authors to remove works from
        the repository may be considered. Public access and availability may be temporarily blocked for
        works under review for removal pending the completion of the investigation into the matter.
        Works may only be removed when an investigation has been completed and after all other options to maintain
        the content in the repository have been explored.
    </p>
    
    <h3>To request removal</h3>
    <p>
        <a href="https://www.k-state.edu/copyright/dmca/" target="_blank">
            Submit a Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) or copyright infringement claim.
        </a>
    <p>

    <p>
        Contact the Center for Scholarly Publishing for general requests to remove works
        from the repository at <a href="mailto:cads@k-state.edu">cads@k-state.edu</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>Retention policy</h3>
    <p>
        The retention of digital works and items in the IR shall be indefinite.
        K-State Libraries will attempt to keep and maintain the digital works housed in the
        IR for as long as it is feasible to do so but may remove works and content from the IR at its discretion.
        Reasons to remove works and content include, but are not limited to, copyright infringement,
        limiting the liability of K-State from legal challenges and technical considerations,
        such as specified digital works stored in the repository are no longer
        readable by a reasonable level of available technology.
